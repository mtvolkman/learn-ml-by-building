    "# Thought Cascade: Building and Evaluating Agentic AI Systems with Small Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "*An Interactive Journey into Iterative Intelligence*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complete all coding implementations** marked with `TODO` in this notebook (for example, Questions 1, 4, 5, and 6).\n",
    "2. **Complete all analysis sections** explicitly labeled \"Required Analysis\".\n",
    "3. **Run all cells** so that key tables and plots (e.g., single-shot metrics, STRICT tests, QuixBugs results, and ReAct loop outcomes) are visible in your saved notebook.\n",
    "4. **Follow course submission instructions** for exporting your answers (avoid submitting unnecessarily long full-notebook PDFs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: The Rise of Agentic AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider how humans solve complex problems. We rarely get the answer right on the first try. Instead, we form a hypothesis, test it, observe what happens, and refine our approach. We repeat this cycle until we succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional single-shot prompting forces models to \"think\" once and commit to an answer immediately. This is like asking a student to solve a complex math problem without scratch paper or the ability to check their work. Agentic AI, by contrast, gives models the ability to work through problems systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Agentic Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, an agentic system operates in a loop of **Reasoning**, **Acting**, and **Observing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The ReAct Loop: Reasoning, Acting, and Observing](images/react_diagram.png)\n",
    "*Figure 1: The ReAct Loop (Source: [Yao et al., 2022](https://react-lm.github.io/))*\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Agentic AI?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic AI represents a fundamental shift in how we interact with language models. Instead of treating models as passive question-answering systems, we treat them as active problem solvers. These systems can reason about problems iteratively, act in their environment using tools, observe the results, and adapt their approach based on feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that **intelligence emerges not from model size alone, but from the ability to iterate and self-correct**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The ReAct Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on **ReAct** (Reasoning and Acting), one of the most successful patterns for building agentic systems. ReAct interleaves reasoning traces with actions, creating a feedback loop that enables self-improvement. The principles we'll learn—decomposition, tool use, memory, and self-evaluation—apply broadly to any agentic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand** the theoretical foundations of agentic AI and why iteration beats size\n",
    "2. **Build** complete agentic systems using the ReAct pattern\n",
    "3. **Measure** system performance at the component level, not just end-to-end\n",
    "4. **Design** tools that enable effective agent-environment interaction\n",
    "5. **Compare** different models and understand their trade-offs in agentic contexts\n",
    "6. **Diagnose** failure modes and implement recovery strategies\n",
    "7. **Apply** agentic patterns to diverse problem domains"

    "### Understanding Local Model Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use **Hugging Face Transformers** for running models locally. This approach has several advantages:\n",
    "- **Privacy**: Your data never leaves your machine\n",
    "- **Cost**: No API fees or rate limits\n",
    "- **Control**: Full control over model versions and configurations\n",
    "- **Learning**: Better understanding of model behavior and limitations\n",

    "#### Implementing Upgraded Spec and Stronger Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's translate your analysis into code. Based on the gaps you identified in Question 1, you will now implement a stronger test suite that covers those missing edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided the structure for an oracle-based testing framework. Your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement the Oracle**: Complete `leftmost_index_or_minus_one` to define the correct behavior (ground truth).\n",
    "2. **Add Adversarial Cases**: In `build_strict_tests`, define specific deterministic inputs that stress duplicates, boundaries, and midpoints.\n",
    "3. **Add Randomized Tests**: Implement the generator for random inputs to cover a wider range of scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stronger suite will likely cause the buggy baseline to fail and push single-shot pass rates down—demonstrating why simple tests are insufficient and setting up the need for ReAct."

    "### 1.6 Analyzing QuixBugs Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results above give us a snapshot of single-shot performance on a diverse benchmark. Take a moment to inspect the plots and the pass rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pass@1**: How often does the model get it right on the first try?\n",
    "- **Failure Types**: Are we seeing mostly compilation errors or logic bugs?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use these observations to answer **Question 2.4** below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2 (Short Answer, 10 points): Evaluation, Specs, and Single-Shot Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your experimental results with both the **minimal tests** and the upgraded **STRICT tests/spec** for `binary_search`, as well as the **QuixBugs** benchmark, reflect on the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2.1: Impact of Stronger Specs and Tests**\n",
    "How did the single-shot success metrics (e.g., pass@1, average pass rate) change when you moved from the minimal tests to the STRICT tests? What does this tell you about how much our *evaluation setup* can hide or reveal model weaknesses?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2.2: Failure Modes Under STRICT Tests**\n",
    "Looking at the concrete failing cases under the STRICT tests (including duplicates, boundary cases, and any compilation errors), what patterns do you see in how the model fails? Are these small off-by-one issues, misunderstandings of the leftmost-index spec, extraction/compilation problems, or something else?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2.3: Broader Implications for Agentic AI and Evaluation**\n",
    "What challenges do these observations reveal for agentic AI or AI systems in general? Consider at least one of: (a) the difficulty of writing complete specifications, (b) the risk of overestimating model capability from weak tests, or (c) the need for iterative evaluation (e.g., pass@K, self-diagnosis, oracles) when building reliable agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2.4: QuixBugs Performance**\n",
    "Reflect on the QuixBugs results:\n",
    "- Which problems are consistently solved vs. consistently failed? Do they share structural properties?\n",
    "- How often do failures stem from compilation errors vs. buggy-but-compiled behavior?\n",
    "- Based on the stacked failure plots, where would you focus improvement effort first (prompting, extraction, tests, or model choice)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize your answers to Q2.1–Q2.4 in a short paragraph or bullet list. Make sure to connect the quantitative changes in metrics to qualitative observations about failure modes and evaluation design."

    "In this question, you will experiment with alternative prompts for `single_shot_debugging` and see how they change model behavior under both the minimal and STRICT tests.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Learn how to convert reasoning traces (thoughts) into structured, executable actions. This is where the ReAct pattern translates plans into concrete steps the agent can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**: After the model generates a thought about what to try next, we need to convert that reasoning into a structured action. In our code debugging domain, actions are JSON objects like:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"tool\": \"fix_code\", \"params\": {\"code\": \"def binary_search(...)...\"}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why JSON?** Structured output enables:\n",
    "- Reliable parsing (vs. free-form text)\n",
    "- Type safety (we know what fields to expect)\n",
    "- Tool routing (the \"tool\" field determines what happens next)\n",
    "- Composability (easy to add new tools later)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task**: Implement action generation that prompts the model to produce valid JSON actions based on its reasoning. You'll also handle parsing failures gracefully - a critical skill when working with small models that sometimes produce malformed output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Note**: The helpers you build here (generate_thought and generate_action) are intentionally generic: they should work for any debugging task described in the task string, not just the binary_search example. Later, we'll reuse the same components on the QuixBugs benchmark."
