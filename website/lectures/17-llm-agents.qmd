title: "Lecture 17: LLM Agents & Tool Use"
subtitle: "From prompting to acting: reasoning, tools, and multi-agent systems"
---

## Overview

Large Language Models are more than chatbots—they can plan, call tools, and take actions. This lecture shows how to turn an LLM into an agent: structuring outputs, invoking external functions/APIs, and iterating with reasoning-and-action loops (ReAct). We contrast naive prompting with constrained and schema-validated approaches, calibrate model decisions via log-prob scoring, and discuss evaluation, safety, and failure modes when models act in the real world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:


- **Understand LLM versatility** - Recognize that LLMs are general-purpose text processors capable of classification, extraction, reasoning, and generation tasks
- **Implement tool use** - Build systems that enable LLMs to interact with external functions and APIs through structured tool calling
- **Create ReAct agents** - Develop agents that combine reasoning and acting in an iterative loop to solve multi-step problems
- **Fine-tune models** - Customize language models for specific domains through efficient fine-tuning techniques
