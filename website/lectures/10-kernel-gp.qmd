title: "Lecture 10: Kernel Methods & Gaussian Processes"
subtitle: "Learning Probability Distributions Over Functions"
---

## Overview

In this lecture, we explore Gaussian Processes (GPs) - a fundamentally different approach to machine learning that excels when neural networks fail. Instead of learning a single prediction function, GPs learn probability distributions over entire function spaces, providing principled uncertainty quantification with limited data.

- Gaussian Processes as distributions over functions: priors, posteriors, and the role of kernels
- Kernel engineering: composing simple kernels (RBF, Periodic, Linear) to encode domain knowledge
- Small data advantage: why GPs outperform neural networks with sparse training data
- Deep kernel learning: combining neural network feature extractors with GP inference
- Real-world applications: CO₂ forecasting with uncertainty and semantic ambiguity prediction from images

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will:

- Understand the paradigm shift from learning single predictions to learning probability distributions over functions
- Design and combine kernels to encode domain knowledge about patterns in data (trends, seasonality, smoothness)
- Apply GPs effectively when neural networks fail due to limited training data
- Obtain calibrated confidence intervals and quantify prediction uncertainty
- Implement deep kernel learning by using neural networks as feature extractors for GPs
- Make informed model choices between GPs and neural networks for real-world problems
