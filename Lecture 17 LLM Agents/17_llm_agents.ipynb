    "# LLM Agents & Tool Use: From Chat to Action\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved far beyond simple chatbots. Today's lecture explores how LLMs can be transformed into intelligent agents capable of reasoning, using tools, and taking actions to solve complex problems. We'll build from fundamental concepts to practical implementations, demonstrating how to create agents that can search for information, perform calculations, and debug code.\n",

    "By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand LLM versatility** - Recognize that LLMs are general-purpose text processors capable of classification, extraction, reasoning, and generation tasks\n",
    "2. **Implement tool use** - Build systems that enable LLMs to interact with external functions and APIs through structured tool calling\n",
    "3. **Create ReAct agents** - Develop agents that combine reasoning and acting in an iterative loop to solve multi-step problems\n",
    "4. **Fine-tune models** - Customize language models for specific domains through efficient fine-tuning techniques"

    "- **Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined classes\n",

Research shows that [instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01652) and [in-context learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00234) enable this versatility without task-specific training."

    "\n",
    "**Core Learnings:**\n",
    "- LLMs are versatile text processors capable of far more than chat - they can classify, extract, reason, and generate across diverse domains\n",
    "- Tool integration transforms LLMs from passive generators to active agents that can interact with the world\n",
    "- The ReAct pattern enables complex problem-solving through iterative reasoning and action\n",
    "- Fine-tuning allows rapid specialization for domain-specific tasks with minimal data and training time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Start simple with basic tool integration before building complex agent systems\n",
    "- Prompt engineering dramatically impacts performance - invest time in crafting good prompts\n",
    "- Local models like Qwen and GPT-2 are sufficient for many applications\n",
    "- Fine-tuning doesn't require massive datasets - even 1000 examples can teach new domains\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of LLM agents is rapidly evolving, with new capabilities emerging constantly. The foundations you've learned today - tool use, ReAct loops, and fine-tuning - will remain relevant as models improve. Most importantly, you now have the practical skills to build your own agent systems, limited only by your imagination and the problems you choose to solve."
